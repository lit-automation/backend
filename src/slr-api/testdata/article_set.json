        "title": "A Unified Approach for Modeling Inelastic Behavior of Structural Metals under Complex Cyclic Loadings.",
        "abstract": "This report develops a general procedure for modeling the inelastic stress-strain response of structural metals subjected to complex irregular cyclic loadings. The model is ideally suited for programming on a digital computer and uses \"cyclic\" material parameters (or properties) determined from simple constant strain amplitude cyclic tests. Four model formulations which include three degrees of simplification in the model are proposed and their appropriate applications are indicated. In its most complete formulation, the model is capable of simulating all the important observed phenomena of a wide range of structural metals, including hotworked and coldworked steels and aircraft aluminums. These phenomena include \"memory\" of prior history, cyclic hardening, cyclic softening, cyclic relaxation, cyclic creep, and the observed deviation from the Masing behavior. A major contribution of this report is in the development of a unified characterization of these phenomena. The model and the \"cyclic\" material parameters developed provide the necessary base for formulating a general constitutive equation in the multiaxial state of stress. Such constitutive equations are directly adoptable in the finite element codes of nonlinear structural analysis programs. The model is also useful in realistic shakedown analysis of structures and fatigue analysis of complex load histories.",

        "abstract": "It was 1890 in the Pemigewasset valley of New Hampshire’s White Mountains, and the loggers attacked the stand of trees with grim determination. Two men downed the trees with five-foot-long crosscut saws — known affectionately as “misery whips” — and then laid the hardwoods on the ground. They rolled the precious spruce and pines over them and down the side of the mountain to waiting sleds, where a tender carefully loaded them. A teamster snapped the reins and drove the horse-powered sleds through the woods to a river or railroad siding (figure 1.1). There the logs were sent on their way to waiting sawmills, to be turned into lumber for a growing nation with a voracious appetite for wood.",

        "title":"The impact of failing, flaky, and high failure tests on the number of crash reports associated with Firefox builds",
        "abstract":"Testing is an integral part of release engineering and continuous integration. In theory, a failed test on a build indicates a problem that should be fixed and the build should not be released. In practice, tests decay and developers often release builds, ignoring failing tests. In this paper, we studying the link between builds with failing tests and the number of crash reports on the Firefox webbrowser. Builds with all tests passing have a median of only two crash reports. In contrast, builds with one or more failing tests are associated with a median of 508 and 291 crash reports for Beta and Production builds, respectively. We further investigate the impact of ``flaky'' tests, which can both pass and fail on the same build, and find that they have a median of 514 and 234 crash reports for Beta and Production builds. Finally, building on previous research that has shown that tests that have failed frequently in the past will fail frequently in the future, we find that Builds with HighFailureTests have a median of 585 and 780 crash reports for Beta and Production builds. Unlike other types of test failures, HighFailureTests have a larger impact on Production releases than on Beta builds, and they have a median of 2.7 times more crashes than builds with normal test failures. We conclude that ignoring test failures is related to a dramatic increase in the number of crashes reported by users.",

        "abstract": "Researchers, students and practitioners often encounter a situation when the build process of a third-party software system fails. In this paper, we aim to confirm this observation present mainly as anecdotal evidence so far. Using a virtual environment simulating a programmer's one, we try to fully automatically build target archives from the source code of over 7,200 open source Java projects. We found that more than 38% of builds ended in failure. Build log analysis reveals the largest portion of errors are dependency-related. We also conduct an association study of factors affecting build success.",

        "title":"Automated localization for unreproducible builds",
        "abstract":"Reproducibility is the ability of recreating identical binaries under pre-defined build environments. Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries. In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.",

One of the things British Columbia and Queensland had in common in the mid-nineteenth century was large Indigenous populations. Like George Carrington and Edmund Hope Verney, most white commentators had very little to say about Indigenous people that was favourable. Not only were Indigenous people in general racially denigrated, the masculinity of Indigenous men was contrasted with and found wanting against white hegemonic standards.",

It describes the role of the British in shaping many cultural features that are now often associated with being simply American. Noting the British themselves were culturally diverse, this chapter focuses upon those four British groups identified by Fischer (1989. Albion’s Seed: Four British Folkways in America. New York: Oxford University Press) as having had distinctive contributions to the American landscape: the Puritans from East Anglia, Quakers from the Midlands, gentry and commoners from south central England, and the Scots and Scots-Irish. The influences of these groups upon architecture, community arrangements, toponyms, and land tenure are reviewed. In addition, the distinctive ethnic settlements of several other groups from Great Britain, including the Welsh and Cornish, as well as those from Ireland, are discussed.",

        "title": "An Empirical Analysis of Build Failures in the Continuous Integration Workflows of Java-Based Open-Source Software",
        "abstract": "Continuous Integration (CI) has become a common practice in both industrial and open-source software development. While CI has evidently improved aspects of the software development process, errors during CI builds pose a threat to development efficiency. As an increasing amount of time goes into fixing such errors, failing builds can significantly impair the development process and become very costly. We perform an indepth analysis of build failures in CI environments. Our approach links repository commits to data of corresponding CI builds. Using data from 14 open-source Java projects, we first identify 14 common error categories. Besides test failures, which are by far the most common error category (up to >80% per project), we also identify noisy build data, e.g., induced by transient Git interaction errors, or general infrastructure flakiness. Second, we analyze which factors impact the build results, taking into account general process and specific CI metrics. Our results indicate that process metrics have a significant impact on the build outcome in 8 of the 14 projects on average, but the strongest influencing factor across all projects is overall stability in the recent build history. For 10 projects, more than 50% (up to 80%) of all failed builds follow a previous build failure. Moreover, the fail ratio of the last k=10 builds has a significant impact on build results for all projects in our dataset.",

        "title": "Do Not Trust Build Results at Face Value - An Empirical Study of 30 Million CPAN Builds",
        "abstract": "Continuous Integration (CI) is a cornerstone of modern quality assurance, providing on-demand builds (compilation and tests) of code changes or software releases. Despite the myriad of CI tools and frameworks, the basic activity of interpreting build results is not straightforward, due to not only the number of builds being performed but also, and especially, due to the phenomenon of build inflation, according to which one code change can be built on dozens of different operating systems, run-time environments and hardware architectures. As existing work mostly ignored this inflation, this paper performs a large-scale empirical study of the impact of OS and run-time environment on build failures on 30 million builds of the CPAN ecosystem's CI environment. We observe the evolution of build failures over time, and investigate the impact of OSes and environments on build failures. We show that distributions may fail differently on different OSes and environments and, thus, that the results of CI require careful filtering and selection to identify reliable failure data.",
